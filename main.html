            <p>Welcome to my personal webpage. I specialize in developing innovative AI and blockchain solutions to enhance operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="about">
            <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Throughout my career, I have demonstrated a strong commitment to learning and adapting to new challenges. As the Owner/Operator of StormyIsland3D.com, I have successfully managed day-to-day business operations, crafted engaging presentations, and maintained functional and organized environments to promote business performance. My ability to learn new skills quickly and apply them effectively has been a cornerstone of my professional journey.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the key assets I bring to the table is my proficiency in developing AI agents using platforms such as Streamlit, Firebase, OpenAI, and ChatGPT. I am confident that these technologies can be leveraged to create innovative solutions for any business, such as virtual assistants for customer service, automated data analysis for market trends, and predictive models for property valuations.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to my AI expertise, my experience with Computer-Aided Drafting (CAD) and 3D modeling has honed my ability to read and design schematics, blueprints, and technical drawings. These skills are crucial in understanding property layouts, designing marketing materials, and facilitating communication between clients and contractors.
            </p>
            <p>
                Moreover, my technical background includes industry expertise in blockchain technology. I have built custom blockchain solutions that ensure secure and transparent transactions, which can be particularly beneficial in the small business industry for managing records, contracts, and transactions with enhanced security and efficiency.
            </p>
            <p>
                My experience also extends to network hardware and software maintenance, IT administration, and 3D printing. I hold certifications in Catia V6, Blender 3D, and various programming languages, all of which underscore my capability to handle complex technical tasks and deal with issues efficiently.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am particularly excited about the opportunity to integrate my technical skills with any dynamic environment. The potential to develop AI-driven tools and blockchain applications to streamline operations and enhance customer experiences is immense, and I am eager to contribute to the industry.
